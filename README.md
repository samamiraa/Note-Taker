# Note-Taker

Live URL üëáüèº <br>

## Description

Note taker created with express.js where you can add, save, review and delete notes. My motivation to complete this project was to help solidify my understanding. Although there is much more to learn, understanding the basic requests ie. Get, Post & Delete. In the future, I will practice Put & Patch requests as well, but for now this project helped me understand routing on the backend.

## Credits

The class activities are always my first point of reference, but thank you to my tutor Andrew for helping me with my delete request and thank you to my TA Daniel and colleague Shawn for answering questions about an error I was getting in my console.
